# SCE Data Structures and Algorithms Workshop Series

This is the official github repository of the 
data structures and algorithms workshop series
in the SCE. Every workshop hosted will be in a 
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format and will be 
posted in this repository. 

## Purpose
It seems that data structures and algorithms is something
that the SJSU curriculum has been slow on teaching. This 
workshop series helps students get a jump start learning
it and equip them with the tools they need to make more 
efficient code.

## Summary
This is a series of workshops with different instructors. 
Every workshop in this series focuses on a specific data
structure or algorithm, with the exception of the first 
three. To keep the structure of this workshop series uniform, 
the workshops will be taught in python. 

## Topics to be covered
- Beginner Python
- Big O notation
- Lists / Linked Lists / Stacks / Queues
- Sorting
- Searching
- Sliding window algorithm
- Trees / Tries / Heaps
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
